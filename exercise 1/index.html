Hello everyone,

My name is Esther Tetteh. I am a first-year graduate student in the Community and Regional Planning department. I am on campus this semester. I have no experience with HTML and JavaScript but I do have a little experience with coding. I took a Remote Sensing class in my undergraduate studies and CRP 551 last semester. I look forward to learning more about coding and augmenting my mapping skills from this class.
